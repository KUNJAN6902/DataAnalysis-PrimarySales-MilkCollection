What's the best way to give teammates access to the dashboards you created ? 

=> If colleagues need to keep the dashboard up to date, or need access to all the content in the workspace, consider adding them to the workspace.

=> If colleagues just need to see a dashboard and not all the content in the workspace, you again have alternatives :

[1] If a few people need just that one dashboard, then sharing the dashboard could be the best solution.

[2] However, if the dashboard is part of a bigger set of content you need to distribute to many colleagues, then publishing an app is likely the best choice.

For better understanding read following docs :

#1 Collaborate in PowerBI
=> Creating workspace and adding colleagues to workspace to work together + app workspace (for read only sharing)

Refer section "Collaborate in Power BI" :
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-create-the-new-workspaces


#2 Share work in PowerBI
=> Sharing a dashboard or report to recipients to view and interact, but not editing

Refer section "Publish and Share your work" :
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-share-dashboards

Both of these features, are available in PowerBI service only (not in PowerBI Desktop). And, No matter which option you choose to share your content you need a Power BI Pro license, or the content needs to be in a PowerBI Premium capacity.
