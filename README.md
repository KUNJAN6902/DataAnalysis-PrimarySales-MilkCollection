# SalesData and MilkCollection DataAnalysis

=> I performed data analysis on :
  (1) Primary Sales Data of a company and 
  (2) Milk Collection Data of two different villages.

"Milk collection Data Analysis" and "Sales Data Analysis" folders uploaded above contain datasets, PowerBI files and PowerBI PDF reports.

=> I have explained my thought process to analyse these datasets in "Data Analysis-My Approach.docx" - file. 
This file answers why I have built PowerBI reports in such way.

Thank You,
